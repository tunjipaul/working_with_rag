Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features of Python:
- Easy to learn and read syntax
- Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
- Extensive standard library
- Support for multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional)
- Large and active community

Python Data Types:
Python has several built-in data types including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Lists are mutable ordered collections, while tuples are immutable. Dictionaries store key-value pairs.

Control Structures:
Python uses if-elif-else statements for conditional execution and for/while loops for iteration. List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

Functions:
Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword. They can accept positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default parameters. Python also supports lambda functions for simple operations.

Popular Python Applications:
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science and machine learning (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
- Automation and scripting
- Scientific computing
