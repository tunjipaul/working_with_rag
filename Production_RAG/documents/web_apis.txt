Understanding Web APIs

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Web APIs specifically use HTTP protocols to enable communication over the internet.

REST APIs:
REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most common architectural style for web APIs. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods:
- GET: Retrieve data from the server
- POST: Send new data to the server
- PUT: Update existing data
- DELETE: Remove data from the server

HTTP Status Codes:
APIs communicate results through status codes:
- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 404: Not found
- 500: Server error

API Request Components:
1. Endpoint: The URL where the API can be accessed
2. Headers: Additional information like authentication tokens
3. Body: Data being sent with the request (for POST/PUT)
4. Parameters: Query parameters or path variables

JSON Format:
Most modern APIs use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for data exchange due to its simplicity and language-independent nature. JSON represents data as key-value pairs and supports nested structures.

API Authentication:
Common authentication methods include API keys, OAuth tokens, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). These ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources.

Best Practices:
- Use proper HTTP methods
- Return appropriate status codes
- Version your API
- Provide clear documentation
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS for security
