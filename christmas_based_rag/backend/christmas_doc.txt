# The Complete Guide to Christmas

## 1. History and Origins of Christmas

Christmas is an annual Christian festival celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25th as both a religious holiday and a cultural celebration around the world. The word "Christmas" comes from the Old English term "Cristes maesse," meaning "Christ's Mass." The exact date of Jesus's birth is historically uncertain, but the Church fixed December 25th in the 4th century. Christmas draws from early Christian traditions as well as pagan winter festivals, particularly Roman Saturnalia and Germanic Yule celebrations. By the 12th century, Christmas became one of the most important festivals in the Christian calendar. Its modern form was largely shaped during the Victorian era of the 19th century.
