    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Build a document management system using Chroma with rich metadata and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a collection of at least 30 documents with metadata:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   metadata = {\n",
    "       \"category\": \"...\",  # e.g., \"tech\", \"business\", \"science\"\n",
    "       \"date\": \"...\",      # e.g., \"2024-01-15\"\n",
    "       \"author\": \"...\",    # e.g., \"John Doe\"\n",
    "       \"priority\": ...    # e.g., 1, 2, 3\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement queries with different filters:\n",
    "   - By category\n",
    "   - By date range\n",
    "   - By author\n",
    "   - Combined filters (e.g., category AND date)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) if Chroma supports it\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare results with and without filters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "documents = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"text\": \"Python 3.12 introduces new performance improvements...\",\n",
    "        \"metadata\": {\n",
    "            \"category\": \"tech\",\n",
    "            \"date\": \"2024-01-15\",\n",
    "            \"author\": \"Tech Team\",\n",
    "            \"priority\": 1\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    # Add 29 more...\n",
    "]\n",

    "1. **Vector databases enable fast similarity search** at scale using approximate nearest neighbor algorithms.\n",
