    "## 4.1 Indexing Phase (Offline)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Process documents and prepare them for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Document Collection\n",
    "- Gather documents from various sources (PDFs, databases, web pages, etc.)\n",
    "- Clean and normalize data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Document Chunking\n",
    "- Split documents into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks)\n",
    "- **Why?** Documents are usually too long to process at once\n",
    "- Typical chunk size: 200-1000 tokens\n",
    "- May include overlap between chunks to preserve context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original Document (5000 words)\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "Chunking (500 words per chunk)\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "10 chunks with 50-word overlap\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Embedding Generation\n",
    "- Convert each chunk into a numerical vector (embedding)\n",
    "- Embeddings capture semantic meaning\n",
    "- Similar chunks have similar embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text Chunk: \"The cat sat on the mat\"\n",
    "        ↓ (Embedding Model)\n",
    "Vector: [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ..., 0.3] (e.g., 384 dimensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Chunk 1: \"The cat sat on the mat\"\n",
    "Embedding: [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ..., 0.3]\n",

    "Embedding: [0.21, -0.48, 0.79, ..., 0.31]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Notice the vectors are very close → RAG knows these chunks are semantically similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Vector Storage\n",
    "- Store embeddings in a vector database\n",
    "- Store original text alongside embeddings\n",
    "- Store metadata (source, page number, date, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector Database Examples:**\n",

    "Query Vector: [0.25, -0.48, 0.82, ..., 0.29]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Similarity Search\n",
    "- Find chunks with embeddings most similar to query embedding\n",
    "- Use cosine similarity or other distance metrics\n",
    "- Retrieve top-k most similar chunks (e.g., k=5)\n",
