    "2. **Chunk size matters:**\n",
    "   - Small chunks (100-300 tokens): Precise but may lose context\n",
    "   - Medium chunks (300-600 tokens): Best starting point\n",
    "   - Large chunks (600-1000 tokens): More context but less precise\n",

    "3. **Chunking strategies:**\n",
    "   - Character-based: Simple but breaks words/sentences\n",
    "   - Word-based: Better, but still breaks sentences\n",
    "   - Sentence-based: **Recommended for most cases**\n",
    "   - Paragraph-based: Good for structured documents\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overlap is important:**\n",
    "   - Maintains context between chunks\n",
    "   - 10-20% overlap is typical\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Metadata is crucial:**\n",
    "   - Enables source attribution\n",
    "   - Allows filtering and navigation\n",
    "   - Builds trust and verifiability\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Test and iterate to find what works\n",
